          <p class="flip-card-back-text">In the hidden corner of the Trifid Nebula where the stars are born the unicorns lived in peace and compassion, frolicking in technicolor fields of sparkling space-dust. And though they lived in absolute harmony their songs and legends prophesied a savior, the Golden Unicorn, who would appear to them one day in their hour of deepest need. But what need could unicorns possibly have in their perfect world?</p>

          <p class="flip-card-back-text">Born from the explosive star-deaths in the Cat's Eye Nebula and crafted from the shadows between the galaxies, the interstellar traveler-beast known as Laser Kitteh sought out the fabled home of his ancient enemy, the Golden Unicorn, and found it in the Trifid Nebula. He waged vicious war on the unicorns, showing no mercy, using his laser-eye to transform them into kitteh clones and turning the tide in his favor. Who can stand against his wrath?</p>
