        In a little corner of the Trifid Nebula where the stars are born the nation of unicorns lived in peace and compassion, frolicking in technicolor fields of sparkling space-dust, until the interstellar traveler-beast called Laser Kitteh appeared and began to wage war on the unicorn-kind. He showed no mercy, using his laser-eyes to transform the unicorns into clones of himself. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The unicorns cried out for a leader, the one sang of in their nursery rhymes and written about in their storybooks: the Golden Unicorn. His arrival would signal the downfall of the Laser Kitteh and his kitteh-clones and the return of peace and harmony to unicorn-kind!
